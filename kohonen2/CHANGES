This package contains modifications to the kononen package version 2.0.9
The kohonen package version 2.0.0 is originally described in 
R. Wehrens and L.M.C. Buydens, J. Stat. Softw. 21(5), 2007

This modified package in termed kohonen2 and developed by Alan Boyle
The modified package is included in:
"Dynamic Trans-Acting Factor Co-localization in Human Cells". Cell 2013
Authors:  Dan Xie*, Alan P Boyle*, Linfeng Wu*, Jie Zhai, Trupti Kawli, Michael Snyder

Changes in kohonen2:
- map.c is modified to handle large data sets. This is accomplished by moving
	the calculation of minimum distance and classification from R to the C code.
	This is matched with changes to map.R which no longer needs to perform large
	matrix calculations. These changes save a lot of memory.

- map.R is also modified to start classifications at 1 instead of 0 which has
	caused some problems in downstream analysis. R does not like 0 indexing

- plot.kohonen.R is modified to include hexagonal plotting, better drawing of
	borders, and a new classes plot which shows pie charts in the neurons
